# Simple-Pass
This is a part of my react.js learning.simplePass is a solution for people who does not want to trust any password vault for accessing their passwords from anywhere any device.It is ideal fro people who can remember a large secret master password and safely store some keys which need be kept as a secret.Privacy of keys are not a concern because they are useless for password generation unless someone have access to master password.So keys can be written somewhere , saved in a simple text file or you can use our option to save them to browser's local storage.

Only CSS is used for styling.
